  <p>
    The API I selected is called Exchange Rates API. It gives access to foreign exchange rates
    and is published by the European Central Bank.
    I found it at https://exchangeratesapi.io/. <br />
    For my API request I used the /latest option to get current exchange rates relative to the Euro
    (as the Euro is the default base). The API does allow for historical exchange rates also. <br />
    This API would be useful on a website that calculates a conversion between a lump sum in one
    country's currency and a lump sum in another country's currency. 
    This API would also be useful on a website that allows you to see which countries have
    the lowest or highest valued currencies.
